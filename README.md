# Fast Positioning Indoor Vehicle with Visual Gimbal Based on UWB and ROS
The [final report](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/Fast-Positioning-Indoor-Vehicle-with-Visual-Gimbal-Based-on-UWB-and-ROS/blob/main/%E7%BB%93%E9%A2%98%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A_%E4%B8%80%E7%A7%8D%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%20uwb%20%E8%AE%BE%E5%A4%87%E5%92%8C%20ros%20%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E7%9A%84%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E5%AE%A4%E5%86%85%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E8%A7%86%E8%A7%89%E4%BA%91%E5%8F%B0%E5%B0%8F%E8%BD%A6.pdf) describes in detail the various functions of the cart: the cart controlled by the STM32, the power divider board, the UWB positioning system, the path planning implemented on the Raspberry Pi, and the visual gimbal auto-tracking system based on OpenMV and K210.

The [main](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/Fast-Positioning-Indoor-Vehicle-with-Visual-Gimbal-Based-on-UWB-and-ROS/tree/main/main) is the code of our cart.

The [tracking.py](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/Fast-Positioning-Indoor-Vehicle-with-Visual-Gimbal-Based-on-UWB-and-ROS/blob/main/tracking.py) is the code on the k210.
